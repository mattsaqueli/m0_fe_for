# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

So far I have a good understanding with the For Statement. Although I do think I can improve in some areas.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

With this lesson I had a mix of both, thankfully more of productive struggle but the last challenge tripped me up.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

Conditionals, I will review that a ton before our final eval on Friday during my free time yesterday while still taking breaks. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

None at the moment, if any questions come up I'll troubleshoot with Google, my small group, and/or study hall.
